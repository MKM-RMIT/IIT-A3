           <h2>Skills and Jobs</h2>
           <h3>Position 1</h3>
           <p>As our project goal is creating an application, we need to a professional programmer who has the ability and skills of Java, HTML, CSS and other programs that can make an application, as well as a deep understanding of making apps and at least experience of 5 apps or programs like ours.</p>
           As the team has never worked on a project with these variables and requirements, the familiarity with some of the applications required to run the program will be poor. Specifically for Oracle database and Vision AI. There is only so much the team can learn from researching the applications. Understanding the limits of the applications might not be understandable until working with the application, this is a risk as once identifying lack of functionality in a software, it might be too late to turn to other solutions.</p>
           <h3>Position 2</h3>
           <p>Another position can belong to an outsource software testing.
           Outsource software testing is the process of handing over your project to an independent team which is specalised in testing the application and providing on pros & cons. They will purely be there to do testing and are not apart of the software development.</p>
           <p>Once the application has been approved within the internal team, we are able to hire an outsource app testing company to ensure the quality & functionality of product while also making sure there are no bugs once we go live. Further to this, the outsource company will be able to list pro's and con's with the applications & software for other possibilities moving forward.</p>
           <p>As the testing is outsourced, you will not to need to manage the team conducting the tests however communication will be heavily relied upon once a report is made for the application.</p>
           <h3>Position 3</h3>
           <p>A position required for our project includes a project manager. Although the technical side of the project is very important, it is also important to ensure resources are allocated in all areas.</p>
           <p>A project manager will provide a level of experience and knowledge when planning what is required for the project to run smoothly.</p>
           <p>As the project grows more micro projects will be required and with this, will require management. Specifically the project manager will provide skills in managing these areas, such as providing guidance and a foundational road map for how the project is going to be commenced.</p>
           <h3>Position 4</h3>
           <p>A data analyst would be a good addition to the team, as the machine learning model needed for image verification needs large databases of real and fake cards in order to be trained. Creating a useful database requires experience with labelling and cleaning data, in order to keep the real and fake databases separate and free of images that are duplicates or low quality. As data analysts frequently also have to model data and identify patterns in it, they would already have experience with using tools such machine learning and could provide valuable insight there.</p>
