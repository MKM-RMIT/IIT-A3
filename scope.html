           <h2>Scope and Limits</h2>
           <p>Our project idea is very ambitious and requires a medium to high level of technical ability in order to pull off all the foundational requirements of the application. However, access to an application such as this is not easily available to a broad community at an affordable price which allows for a large range for the scope and limits.</p>
           <p>The plan to kick off the project idea involves complex technology ideas which might not be functional within the first proof-of-concept phases. Some of the tools and technologies which may require further time and resources include the ability for the app to scan a physical card and identify “if there is something that looks suspicious or if it looks like it has been affixed”.
           <p>For this to work reliably the database in which the software references will have to contain an extremely large amount of data to pull from.
           The ability to have this operatable at a level which is consistent and reliable will require a complex algorithm and/or an extremely large lists of variables which the software is able to reference and identify. To have this working within early stages of development the limit will require for a standard and more basic functionality with a smaller scope in mind. Rather than extending this over hundreds of card games, expansions and sets, the scope can include potentially one card game and one set to have a proof-of-concept functional.
           An example of the above, would be for the application to only be operatable with Pokémon Sword and Shield. (And one expansion set). This means the development team only must work with a select number of cards and only one card type. This will aid the team in identifying issues when they arise and still provide a functional application with appropriate purpose.</P>
           <p>With a smaller pool of cards to work with, the scope and limits are slightly more streamlined and manageable, to continue this trend and ensure the scope and limits stay reasonable, early stages of the software have the possibility of limiting the number of variables to identify. Our project plan outlines many variables for the software to identify as fake such as, spelling mistakes, symbols and font. However, these might be easily identifiable, variables such as card colour may be a little more difficult to develop and work reliably. Therefore, sticking to the more visually obvious variables will be desirable for the proof-of-concept.</p>
           <p>The scope and limits for this project must be treated with respect from the developers as the project idea is an ambitious idea which has a design idea which does not have room for error. Misinformation is something which a development team does not want, hence creating conservative scope and limits is the main goal in this department of the plan.</p>
