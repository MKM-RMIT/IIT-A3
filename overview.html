           <h2>Overview</h2>
           <p>Lorem ipsum put stuff here blah blah blah</p>
           <h3>Topic</h3>
           <p>Our project idea is a mobile app that can be used to authenticate game & trading cards such as Yu-Gi-OH, Pokémon, baseball and more to ensure that they are real. At a very basic level, the goal is to produce a camera with a database of authentic and fake trading card images that is used to distinguish fake cards. Ultimately this could expand to any machinery that could use this system. This application can be pitched to reselling companies such as Troll and Toad & Mighty Collectibles to make it as seamless as possible when verifying trading cards. We would like this application to be used commercially first but later be rolled out to the wider consumer base after a certain period.</p>
           <h3>Motivation</h3>
           <p><b>What is the motivation for our project?</b><br> 

A recent article written in 2022 by the Nintendo Wire has advised that over 43 billion cards have been sold by Pokémon in March 22 alone. (Fruzzetti, 2022) The line is blurred when it comes to what’s real and fake. <br> 

<b>Why is this project important or interesting? </b><br>

This project is interesting because we would download and install the app to our device easily and use it when buying and selling trading cards for determine whether card is original or fake. Our project would play a crucial role in the reselling of cards, as it can reduce the activity of scammers and helps to destroy fake trading cards over time. <br> 

<b>How does it fit in with current IT trends?</b> <br>

We would need current hardware (computer, mobile) and software skills like Java, HTML, CSS & more for the software to be completed, which are current IT trends. <br></p>
           <h3>Landscape</h3>
           <p>When searching for an application, device or website that could determine a card’s authenticity, we only found webpages such as WikiHow with a few paragraphs of information about the characteristics of authentic cards, advising how a card owner should check their card themselves. This differs a lot from our project because the websites like this only give information about a particular trading card series such as Pokémon cards, but the application that we would create will check multiple series, like Pokémon trading cards, Baseball trading cards, Films trading cards and more. <br>

Additionally, as written above the websites only give information about trading cards, but the application that we will create has multiple steps like scanning cards by the user device’s camera, then comparing the users scanned card with an original card’s data which are exist in application’s storage and then give a result whether card is fake or original. </p>
