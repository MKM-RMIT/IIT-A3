           <h2>Testing</h2>
           <p>Having a test plan for the application is an absolute must, it is crucial for the development of the project. Without the testing phase, we are sure to release an app with bugs and errors. Some procedures we will have implemented to ensure the success off the application include building the project via the Android OS before porting it over to IOS, utilising different phone testbenches and virtual boxes via computer. These methods are specifically used to make sure the application will work. Although having the app work is different to having the app function, to make sure we are able to use the app to verify and authenticate trading cards -alternate testing methods will need to be used; We are to utilise an outsourcing software testing company to verify our product and confirm reliability of application while also stress testing to find any bugs. </p>
