           <h2>Group processes and communications</h2>
           <p>Communication between the team is the most vital part of any project, without proper communication you are setting yourself up for failure. Team Basilisk utilised Microsoft Teams as the main avenue of communication. This included chat functionality as well as VOIP. We have weekly meetings booked in for Thursdays & Saturdays at a set time however we always had the option to make spontaneous calls if deemed necessary. We have a member that is overseas and does not have the greatest internet for VOIP, we have communicated with this member via the chat functionality and have been going strong. We have a file system in place as well to share all of our documents live to provide each other with input and constructive criticism/suggestions to allow us to make necessary changes. </p>
