           <h2>Risks</h2>
           <p>Any project has generic risks to consider when planning, outside of these generic risks the team is to be aware of some of the following points.
           Some of the tools and technologies required for the project are complex and will be difficult to learn, the extent of the risk is that for the team to completely fail at understanding the software and furthermore, having to consider using an alternative software solution. However, what is more likely, to learn the software will take time and as most projects are usually tight for deadline times, this process of having to learn how to operate software such as Vision AI may affect the deadline goal.</p>
           <p>As the team has never worked on a project with these variables and requirements, the familiarity with some of the applications required to run the program will be poor. Specifically for Oracle database and Vision AI. There is only so much the team can learn from researching the applications. Understanding the limits of the applications might not be understandable until working with the application, this is a risk as once identifying lack of functionality in a software, it might be too late to turn to other solutions.</p>
           <p>The team has limited experience when dealing with databases, as there are many roles in managing a database, the limited experience has the risk of the team not being used to the procedures such as backing up the database affectively and in an ethical manner. The risks can lead to data loss or leakage.</p>
