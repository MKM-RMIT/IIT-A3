           <h2>Aims</h2>
           <p>Our aim with this project is to vastly reduce trading card scams by rendering such scams an unprofitable and risky activity. This will be achieved by creating an app that is usable by a person with no experience with cards and only basic technological literacy that allows them to determine the authenticity of a card in under two minutes. If card scams can be detected by anyone, scammers can then be easily reported and shut down.<br>

To achieve this, we have set smaller goals that we can work towards to in order to produce the final product.<br> 

Create a mock-up of the app UI so that the team has a visual idea of what to work towards. This is necessary to ensure consistency in the app, as giving a verbal description of something’s appearance and function to four people will be re-imagined in four slightly different ways that may or may not be compatible with each other. <br>

Collect a large image dataset of genuine and counterfeit cards. This will likely be crowdsourced from online trading card communities such as those on Reddit, and then handed over to a data analyst to be cleaned and sorted. This is an absolute must in order to proceed with the next goal. <br>

The next goal is to produce a machine learning model using this dataset and TensorFlow in order to allow the app to detect counterfeit cards using images alone. This will allow users to check the legitimacy of cards by only pressing a single button to upload an image. Streamlining the efficiency of the app in the way is necessary for it to maintain its competitive edge.<br> 

Create a set of questions that can assist the app in detecting fake cards if the results of the image analysis are inconclusive. Murphy’s law states that what can go wrong will go wrong- it is inevitable that the app will run into edge cases where the machine learning model will not be able to handle them, and it is wise to have a contingency plan for those edge cases. </p>
